 ![Me - 2020](assets/me.jpg)

My name is Weston Mauz and I am from Golden, Colorado, in the United States of America. As of April 5, 2021, I am embarking on an engineering assignment in Tainan, Taiwan for the next 18 months with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).

This blog will be a representation of what I see, experience, and learn while in the East. I will not glamorize the experience, nor display this time as fantasy. I intend to keep these depictions raw and unfiltered.

I look forward to sharing my experience with you.
